Task: Develop a system that identifies subthemes and their sentiment within a piece of text.

Approach: 

Data Preprocessing:
Clean the text (remove punctuation, stop words).
Tokenize the text (split into words).

Subtheme Identification:
Use pre-trained Named Entity Recognition (NER) models to identify relevant entities.

Sentiment Analysis: Done using the NER model

Benefits of this Approach:

Simple: Uses readily available tools and avoids complex techniques for a fresher.
Scalable: Can be easily adapted to different types of reviews by adjusting subtheme keywords.
Interpretable: Results are clear and easy to understand.
Fast processing: Tokenization using vectorization insted of working on each text in a loop saves time by using
the GPU of the system for grid analysis.

Optimization Strategies used:
Preprocessing (Text Cleaning):

Consider vectorized string operations using libraries like pandas.Series.str instead of loops for basic cleaning tasks.
Explore pre-built libraries like nltk.corpus for stop words instead of creating your own list.
NER (Integration):

Batch Processing: Instead of processing each text entry individually, consider processing them in batches using spaCy's 
batch processing capabilities. This can improve efficiency.

Feature Engineering (TF-IDF):

Used a pre-computed TF-IDF vocabulary instead of calculating it from scratch for every new dataset. You can save the vocabulary 
after training the model on a smaller set and use it for subsequent processing.
Model Training (Optional):

Drawbacks of this Approach:

Accuracy: Pre-trained models might not perfectly capture context or sarcasm.
Limited Subthemes: Keyword matching might miss relevant subthemes not predefined.
